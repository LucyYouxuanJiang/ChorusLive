*** TO-DO LIST ***

-- Move memory module to the right side of screen for chat workers (change css automatically??)
-- When new memory item added, don't reorder (our new collect memory items, then rerank will take care of this)
-- "Add memory" button needs some space near the top to avoid overlapping radio buttons
-- REFACTOR PROJECT!! Keep "Memory" functions in a separate file, as with "Messages," "Ranks," and so on.
